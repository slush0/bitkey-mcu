# Contribute to Trezor MCU

Please read the general instructions you can find on our [wiki](https://wiki.trezor.io/Developers_guide:Contributing).

**This repository currently does not accept any new features**, see the wiki for rationale. You probably want to contribute to the [trezor-core](https://github.com/trezor/trezor-core) repository.
